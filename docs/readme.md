# Documentation

Documentation covers all functionality of the library in a detailed way, but if you want a full-fledged code sample then deep dive into example projects.
Documentation consists of five sections. **RabbitMQ configuration section** covers ways of configuring the connection to the RabbitMQ host or multiple hosts if it is a high availability cluster.
**Exchange configuration section** explains the difference between consumption and production exchanges in terms of this library as well as specific nuances of configuring them.
**Message production section** says about features of sending messages and **message consuming section** covers ways of receiving and handling messages.
Last section **Advanced usage** covers specific usage of the RabbitMQ services that can be useful for users who want to set up a tighter behavior control.
